This fork dedicates itself to getting Crunchyroll Beta to function. Thanks to Ryban for the Tampermonkey script otherwise me making this wouldn't have been possible. 
It's been confirmed and working that this works on Chromium-based browsers (so Chrome, MSEdge will work). It has also been tested on Firefox, and it works on there as well (yay). 

# Installation instructions
To install this, you'll need to install the [Tampermonkey extension](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) and you'll need to add the [Crunchyroll Beta Taiga Title Fix script](https://gist.github.com/ryban/d5d66b51618a98d242d4519ebc1e3b3e) (PS: If that link doesn't work, try [here](https://github.com/nicholasyoannou/taiga/releases/download/crunchyrollbeta-custombuild/cr_beta.userscript.js)). 

To add the script, go to the Tampermonkey Dashboard (click on the extension in the extensions menu > dashboard). Hit the '+' button in the menu left of 'Installed Userscripts'. Paste the script there and then in the editor menu hit file > save. 

Once it's added, you can then install the forked version of Taiga. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/nicholasyoannou/taiga/releases/tag/crunchyrollbeta-custombuild) and download and install TaigaSetup.exe. PS: I've added some stuff in there about what the userscript does, etc, if you want to know. 

# Footnote
And, that's it! If anyone knows how to make it so the script is built in to the Taiga application, well that would be great!
The aim of this build is to generally get Crunchyroll Beta to work, and the interface to me is quite nice. Some may be forced to use it, but eh, everyones opinions will vary.
For now, Say≈çnara!
