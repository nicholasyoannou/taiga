But anyways, hi random peep who decided to install this forked build of taiga,

This build is made in purpose for Crunchyroll Beta to work with Taiga, because, well I do love the interface of Crunchyroll Beta and getting used to it makes me not want to switch back to the old crunchyroll website. As a result, I've made this build for peeps who want Crunchyroll Beta to work with Taiga.

Realistically and legally speaking:
- Taiga's original license still applies (which can be found here - https://github.com/erengy/taiga/blob/develop/LICENSE).
- This build is mainly thanks to Ryban on GitHub for writing the Tampermonkey script (which can be found here: https://gist.github.com/ryban/d5d66b51618a98d242d4519ebc1e3b3e or for some reason if that doesn't work, it can be found here: https://janeber.ru/stuff/taiga/cr_beta.userscript.js).
- This build is also thanks to janeberru#4594 (me, come on, I have to credit myself somewhere) for editing the original Taiga code and recompiling it so Crunchyroll Beta works.

Some helpful info
Crunchyroll Beta still works for detecting the anime title itself without the Tampermonkey script, however it can't detect the actual episode number which, in my opinion pretty much defeats the purpose of Taiga. 
Because Crunchyroll Beta refuses to put the episode number in the tab title, I have to use a Tampermonkey script to tamper with the tab title (from my understanding it basically grabs the episode number from the page and dumps it into the tab title). I have absolutely no idea how to add this in so the script is part of the Taiga application but ...well at least I've made a working build.
If your techy and can help fix this, the fork can be found here: https://github.com/nicholasyoannou/taiga. 

I have to thank the authors of the original Taiga repository for making my job of compiling pretty nice and not too stressful. 

For now, Sayonara!
